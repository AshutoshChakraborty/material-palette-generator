## What is this?

This is a clone of the official Material Design palette generator. It does a couple things:

1. Builds you a full color palette from a given hex color, based on Material Design standards
2. Provides you with complementary colors based off your primary color

## Why is this?

The official Google color palette tool [is embedded and buried deep within their docs](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors) and they hid it from search engines, making it difficult to discover and use.

So I forked it and published my own with some minor improvements. I did not change the way colors are derived.

There are [similar tools out there](http://mcg.mbitson.com), but they get the shades wrong.

If you're wondering, the color output matches that produced in the [Material Theme Editor for Sketch](https://material.io/tools/theme-editor/), so it's a good companion for that.
