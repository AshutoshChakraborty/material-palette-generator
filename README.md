## What is this?

This is a (modified) clone of the official Material Design palette generator. It does a couple things:

1. Builds you a full color palette from a given hex color, based on Material Design standards
2. Provides you with complementary colors based off your primary color

## Why is this?

The official Google palette generator [is embedded and buried deep within their Material docs](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors). Since it's an inline tool, they also hid it from search engines, making it difficult to discover or bookmark.

To make it a little easier to use and to preserve it for our own documentation, we forked it and added some minor improvements. We did not change the way colors are derived.

The color output matches that produced in the [Material Theme Editor for Sketch](https://material.io/tools/theme-editor/), so it's a good companion for that.
