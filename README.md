## What is this?

This is a Material Design palette generator. It does a couple things:

1. Builds you a full color palette from a given hex color, based on Material Design standards
2. Provides you with complementary colors based off your primary color

## Details

It seems that [most of the internet doesn't know](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/37520/how-does-one-generate-a-palette-similar-to-the-ones-in-googles-material-design) that there is an official Google tool for making perfect Material Design color palettes. As such, the [most popular tools out there](http://mcg.mbitson.com/) -  while adequate â€“ don't get the shades correct. Not good for purists.

The official Google tool [is embedded deep within their docs](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors) and they hid it from search engines, making it very hard to discover. So I forked it and published my own with some minor improvements.

If you're wondering, the color output matches that produced in the [Material Theme Editor for Sketch](https://material.io/tools/theme-editor/), so it's a good companion for that.
